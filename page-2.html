	<h1> My favourite photograph</h1>

	<p> I also want to share one of my favourite pictures that I took. I was traveling solo in 2017 and visited Leeds, UK where I studied aborad in 2014. This was Kirkstall Abbey, located outside the city. It was a typical rainy day in England, and I was the only person there. I snapped a really cool shot of what was the abbey's nave. </p>
